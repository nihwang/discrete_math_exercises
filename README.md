#### Introduction to Discrete Math

I am in the process of reading through a textbook called Introduction to Discrete Mathematics and some of the exercise problems asks for me to write a computer program! So I will be saving my progresses here. If anyone has any suggestions it will be greatly appreciated! 

1. Write a computer program to find the next perfect number after 28
    - My attempt
        + I wrote a function to that determines if integers are perfect numbers
        + Next I wrote a function that lets you set a number, and the function will run through 1 till that number and if any of that number is a perfect number it will add to the results array and print it.
